CaseDescription="Check that selective compositing works in most important cases.

- Test steps
	- start test app
	- check that test app is not composited
	- show a normal (non-fullscreen) application window
	- check that application is composited (due to the decorator)
	- iconify the application by raising desktop
	- check that desktop is not composited
	- show a non-decorated RGBA application window
- Post-conditions
	- check that compositing is on (because the topmost window is RGBA)\n"
